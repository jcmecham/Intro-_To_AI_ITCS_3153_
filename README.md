This repository holds the assignments I have created as apart of my Introduction to Artificial Intelligince class.

Assignment1.py - The objective for Assignment1.py is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 board without any of them being able to hit another within 1 move. We implement this using the Hill Climbing algorithim and random restarts to find the ideal state.
