# Intro_To_AI_ITCS_3153 Repository

This repository holds all the assignments I have been working on and created as apart of my Introduction to Artificial Intelligince class at UNC Charlotte



### Assigment1.java
The objective for Assignment1.py is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 board without any of them being able to hit another within 1 move. We implement this using the Hill Climbing algorithim find the ideal state and use random restarts to avoid local minimums.


### Assignment1.py
The objective for this version of assignment 1 is the same. I tried to get ahead and wrote this python version for the assignment. Then the professor informed us a week before the assignment was due, we had to write in Java of C#. So I copied the logic into Java.
