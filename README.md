# Intro-_To_AI_ITCS_3153 Repository

This repository holds all the assignments I have been working on and created as apart of my Introduction to Artificial Intelligince class at UNC Charlotte




#### **Assignment1.py**
The objective for Assignment1.py is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 board without any of them being able to hit another within 1 move. We implement this using the Hill Climbing algorithim and random restarts to find the ideal state.

#### **Assigment1.java**
