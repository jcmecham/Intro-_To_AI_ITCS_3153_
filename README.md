# Intro_To_AI_ITCS_3153 Repository

Holds all my assignments for my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class at UNC Charlotte

### Assigment1.java

The objective for Assignment1.py is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 board without any of them being able to hit another within 1 move. We implement this using the Hill Climbing algorithim find the ideal state and use random restarts to avoid local minimums.

### Assignment1.py

The objective for this version of assignment 1 is the same. I tried to get ahead and wrote this python version for the assignment. Then the professor informed us a week before the assignment was due, we had to write in Java of C#. So I copied the logic into Java.

### Assignment 2 - A * Search

The objective for this assignment was as follows:

1. Create a 15 by 15 grid
2. Pick a Start Node
3. Pick a Goal Node
4. Implement A * Search to find the shortest path between the nodes
